Success of Execution

After building the program, if no assertion errors are shown on your screen, file will be generated successfully, provided you put reasonable limits on some variables. For example, maximum array size should be around 10^6 at max.

If any assertion failed errors were seen on your screen while generating the output, do report the error with the screenshot on the Issues Tab. I will try to update the code then.
